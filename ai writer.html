		<tr><td>Sharples describes the AI writing model used by OpenAI as a “highly souped-up text completer”.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Just as your phone does if it has predictive text turned on, AI writing models look at what has been written before and predict what comes next. But while a phone’s predictive text looks at the last few characters typed, OpenAI’s model can look back at around the last 700 words, and generate hundreds of words of suggested text.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr><td>And what it writes makes sense, because it has been trained on almost all of the written text available on the Internet. It knows the context it is writing in, and so is usually indistinguishable from text written by a human,</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr><td>“It's been trained on Wikipedia. It's been trained on blog articles. It's been trained on e-books, online books, and the world's literature. So it uses that vast database,” said Sharples, explaining it creates an internal “mental store” of how the language is processed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr><td>And it is not just mindlessly regurgitating text either - it can come up with new ideas.
		“This is what still even the developers of these systems don't quite understand - that it's not just parroting text,” he said.</td></tr>
