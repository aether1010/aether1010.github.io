    <td>As obvious as this may sound, asking your child to approach their teacher for helcan do wonders. Figuring out how to get better at math is easier once a teacher is in the loop, as teachers are more than willing to provide one-on-one attention to students that may be struggling in their class. Sitting down with a teacher can help students get the extra attention they need to understand core concepts. Students are usually reluctant to approach their teachers for help outside of class hours, but you’d be surprised to see how enthusiastic teachers are to lend a hand to students who need extra help. Teachers, most likely including your child, have dealt with and helped students struggling in math before and are well-equipped to deal with students that may need extra attention. Recognizing the availability and willingness of a teacher to help is critical to kickstarting one-on-one sessions that can provide your child the extra attention they need to start excelling at math. So if your child is struggling in their math class, encourage them to approach their teacher, explain what they have difficulty understanding, and sit down with them.</td>

    <td>To figure out how to improve in math, start with the basics. It’s important to have a clear and solid grasp of the fundamentals before jumping to the next topic. Students must have a strong command over basic arithmetic functions to effectively tackle problems suited to their grade level. If your child or student wants to master multiplication, they should have a solid conceptual grasp of addition and subtraction. If they’re going to master square numbers and roots, they ought to have a clear command over multiplication and division. Ensuring focus on understanding the fundamentals can go a long way in helping students manage the complexities of the subject. On that note, ensure that your student or child does not skip topics they find overwhelming or challenging and jump to another one. This momentary escape can prove counterintuitive and restrict progress with other mathematical topics.</td>

    <td>A mother helping her child with something on a laptop If a classroom is where the learning happens, it is at home that students get a chance to test what they’ve learned. Making sure that a child consistently tackles the assigned homework is crucial to ensure that they can keep up with the learning in the classroom. Homework is a vehicle that helps students test their grasp of fundamentals and, more importantly, helps them recognize gaps in their learning. Homework isn’t just about getting all the right answers but also about identifying where a student is struggling so that they can inform their teacher and get the extra attention or help they need to bridge crucial learning gaps. Setting aside some time every day, preferably at the same time and place, to focus on and complete the assigned homework after classes can make focusing at home easier while ensuring that students give their homework the time and attention it deserves.</td>

    <td>Whether your child is doing their homework or studying in a classroom, there are a million things that could distract them and limit their ability to focus on their studies. Limiting distractions can go a long way in ensuring their focus. When your child is home, it might help ensure that the TV is switched off and their cell phone is put away so they can give their homework undivided attention. If your child is in the classroom and is sitting beside a friend that wants to discuss the latest episode of a TV show they’ve both been watching, it might be best to save that talk for their lunch break. Keep reminding your child to ward off distractions when they’re in class. When your child studies, ensure they do their best to focus on just that— studying. It might even help to divide their study sessions into 20, 30, or 40 minutes, depending on how long they’re comfortable studying without feeling the need to take a break. Figuring out how to get better at math can be tricky, but restricting distractions is half the work. There’s a reason why classes generally don’t go on for more than an hour.</td>

    <td>Whether your child is in elementary, middle, or high school, it’s not difficult to imagine a moment where they might find themselves overwhelmed by a tricky problem that makes thm wonder if you’re even sitting in the right classroom. Complex math problems take different forms and shapes, depending on whether they deal with simple arithmetics at the elementary level, basic algebra in middle school, or advanced trigonometry in high school. Young girl plays with building blocks The key to solving a complex problem is to take a good look at the problem and ask yourself how you can break it down into smaller parts. If children are looking at a problem and need help understanding how to break it down into simpler and more manageable pieces, it might be because they need to brush up on their fundamentals. It is important to pay close attention to teachers when they explain the steps involved in tackling any problem, complex or straightforward, to have a firm grasp of the approaches available to solve a problem. Essentially, math is just about breaking down complex problems into simpler ones and then dealing with them individually until you arrive at an answer. Understanding how to be good at math is all about breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable chunks.</td>

    <td>In this day and age, with a wealth of resources available on the internet, it’s easy to contemplate the value of good old fashion notes and note-taking. Why should we bother making our own notes when we can find plenty of websites that provide great, concise notes for free? If you’ve ever wondered how to get better at math, there are a few strong reasons why you should consider making your notes. Young boy studying and writing with pencil For starters, making notes can help you improve your conceptual clarity of a subject matter because it involves breaking down complex concepts and information into smaller, digestible chunks using your knowledge and understanding. The very process of writing something down on a piece of paper (or a tablet with a stylus) can be a great way to help with the retention of information. Not only do you end up with a more profound, conceptual clarity of the subject matter you’re studying and ensure that you’re able to retain this subject matter, but you’ll also end up with notes that can help you when you have to revise everything that you’ve learned. It might seem overwhelming to go through bulky textbooks with hundreds of pages, but if you have your notes, the provision of revision may become a breeze. An effective strategy on how to become better at math is consistent note-taking.</td>

    <td>On the surface, it’s easy to dismiss a math problem as a jumble of complex symbols and random numbers. But there has to be more to them, right? Well, there is! Making connections between abstract math problems and the real world can go a long way in helping students understand the relevance of what they’re studying while also demystifying the complexity of the problem. Whenever you’re in class and see your teacher writing down an equation on the board, or explaining the solution to a problem, pause for a moment and ask yourself how this equation or problem might apply to the real world. Could geometry have played a role in designing the desk you’re sitting on? Can arithmetic play a role in helping the phone in your pocket carry out essential functions? Trying to understand something just by remembering it may not help you understand the value and relevance of what you’re studying. However, once you emphasize understanding the importance of what you’re studying, you might find the learning process more rewarding and fulfilling.</td>

    <td>Have you ever been in class and found yourself confused about something being taught, and instead of asking a question, you held back and let the class carry on? Ask yourself why you chose not to ask a question, clarify your doubts, and help your learning. Some students can feel hesitant to ask a question about something they think their peers have understood without asking any questions themselves. Others might feel like slowing down the class and drawing too much attention. However, these are not the thoughts that students should entertain when they’re in a classroom because, as learners, they not only have every right to ask questions, but it is also something that teachers themselves encourage. Teachers love answering questions! There is no such thing as a silly question. Questions are the vehicles that drive and ensure learning. The answer to a question that you ask may help not only you but also your peers. You’d be surprised to know that many of your peers may often have the same questions as you, but are just as shy or afraid to speak up. Determining how to become an expert at math can be tricky, but not if you’re always ready with a question. Students raising their hands in class The practice of asking questions is an important tool to ensure learning in classrooms but also an important life skill that helps you nourish your spirit of inquiry and learning. If you’ve ever wondered how to improve math skills, asking questions in class is an easy way to start.</td>
